# Welcome to Track and Trace  üì±
Source code of the Track &amp; trace app for universities. Project for the Programming Society - Hackathon by the University of Westminster

## Main source code  &nbsp; üõ†
You can find the actual written source code for the iOS & macOS application in the 'TrackAndTrace' folder.

## How do I run this app?  &nbsp; ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
### You will need a device running macOS Catalina or Big Sur!
Download XCode from the Mac App Store & this project from GitHub. Make sure you're running the backend server first and then open the xcode workspace file.
Edit the file 'Server.swift' and change the URL to your local IP or remote server IP.
Plug in your phone (or simulator) and click on the play button (top left menu bar)

## Since it's written in SwiftUI, does it run on Mac too?  &nbsp; üñ•
### We haven't tried that yet, but it might work with some small tweaks!
